# rcm

While preparing for the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) Level 5 guitar exam, I found the number of technical exercises to be overwhelming. 

So I wrote a small program to randomly select a scale exercise and arpeggio exercises for me to practice in a given session.

I also added the pieces and studies I'm planning to play for the exam, and have the program randomly select one of those as well.

Note that this version of program is not "complete" in terms of preparation for the exam. These omissions are intentional, as I haven't started studying everything yet.
    
I'm mostly publishing this here in case this structure (a webpage that randomly selects practice exercises for the RCM exam) helps another 
music student.
